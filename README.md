# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Heart-Failure-Risk-Assessment
This project focuses on building and evaluating a neural network model to predict heart failure using the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset. The goal is to create a model that can assist in identifying individuals at higher risk.
The notebook covers the entire machine learning pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model building, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset. It contains various clinical parameters and the target variable indicating whether a patient experienced heart failure. The dataset is available at Kaggle.

Installation
To run this notebook and reproduce the results, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using pip
